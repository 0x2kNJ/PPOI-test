# x402 Reality Check

## ⚠️ Important Clarification

**There is NO official "x402" or "ERC-402" standard from Coinbase or Ethereum.**

### What "x402" actually is in this repo:

- ✅ A **custom naming convention** for this Baanx/Bermuda project
- ✅ Inspired by HTTP 402 "Payment Required" concept
- ✅ Custom implementation of **pull payments** with ZK privacy
- ❌ **NOT** an official Ethereum standard
- ❌ **NOT** created by Coinbase
- ❌ **NOT** widely adopted standard

### Naming confusion:

The name "x402" combines:
- "x" = common prefix for experimental/extended standards
- "402" = HTTP status code for "Payment Required"
- But this does NOT make it an official ERC/EIP standard

### What this repo actually implements:

1. **Custom Pull Payment Contract** - allows merchants to pull funds with permits
2. **EIP-712 Permits** - for off-chain authorization
3. **ZK Proofs** - for privacy (via Bermuda/Noir)
4. **Subscription System** - recurring payments

### Similar concepts that DO exist:

- **EIP-2612** (Permit) - ERC-20 permit for gasless approvals
- **EIP-3074** (AUTH/AUTHCALL) - Account abstraction
- **ERC-1363** (Payable Token) - Tokens that notify receivers
- But none of these are "x402" specifically

### Conclusion:

This repo contains a **custom implementation** of pull payments, not an official standard.
